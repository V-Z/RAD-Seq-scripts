- 01-05 run were fast, just on login node

- abel_00*, abel_03* are submit and worker are array jobs for Oslo cluster (named Abel), one per sample, each sample is in folder named its name
- sample naming convention: AA012k (AA= A. arenosa, 012 = pop number three digits, k = individual)
- haplotype calling (abel_04*) done separately for diploid and tetraploid samples

- abel_04 is parallel job for Abel cluster

- for ploidy level and other data regarding pops. see our GoogleDoc  table
- AA = A. arenosa, AL = A. lyrata

- I will give you:
- A.lyrata reference genome (with all necessary index etc files for BWA-mem and GATK
- masking file for excessive heterozygosity (sites with putative paralogs) - for last filtering step

- filtering of VCF is for further discussion
